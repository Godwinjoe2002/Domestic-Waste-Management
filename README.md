# Domestic-Waste-Management
Idea For Waste Management System integrating a Bluetooth-enabled weighing machine with a mobile  app to measure collected plastic waste. 

Problem Identified:
People in the country dispose of waste in landfill sites and then burn it.
Burning plastic waste is harmful and does not provide any benefit or recycling value.

Proposed Solution:
Plastic Waste Collection:
Individuals are encouraged to collect and store plastic waste separately in designated containers.

Segregation & Storage:
Only non-biodegradable plastic waste should be brought to a central storehouse.

Weighing & Processing:
Plastic waste is accurately measured using a Bluetooth-enabled weighing machine.

Further Processing (Likely for Recycling):
The document likely explains what happens after the plastic is collected, possibly linking it to recycling or rewards for waste management.

Technology Stack Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: PHP
Design & UI: Figma

Credit-Based Reward System:
Users submit their plastic waste at a Bluetooth-enabled weighing station.
The app calculates the weight of plastic submitted.
Credits are awarded based on the weight (e.g., 1kg = 1 Credit).
The top two contributors in each area receive rewards.
The system automatically updates user details and credits.

Flow of the Process:
User submits plastic waste at the weighing machine.
The machine transmits weight data to the app via Bluetooth.

Details stored in a database:
User name, location, weight submitted.
Credit points are added to the user's profile.
Top contributors are rewarded based on rankings.

Project Benefits:
The government collects non-biodegradable plastic efficiently.
Plastic waste is reused for constructing plastic roads.
The government generates revenue from plastic recycling.
Individuals contributing waste receive certificates as recognition.

Dependencies & Requirements:
User registration with location details (State, District, Area).
Bluetooth-enabled weighing machine for accurate data collection.
Internet connectivity for data syncing.
Database for storing weight & credit details.
